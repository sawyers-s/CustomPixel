## Welcome!
This is the repository for the ARTG2260 Custom Pixel project.

### Setup
Be sure you have the .pde Processing file titled "custom_pixel.pde" for this project. Additionally, make sure your "data" folder contains five files:
1. metgala1.jpg
2. metgala2.jpg
3. metgala3.jpg
4. textfile.txt
5. OldStandardTT-Bold.ttf

Note: All files for this project should be in the same directory/folder for the program to run successfully.

"

Pixels are the fundamental building blocks of bitmap images and digital displays. Conventionally, pixels are square, uniform, and parked in a static Cartesian grid. Challenge these assumptions by writing code to reconstruct an image using custom picture elements of your own choosing. What if pixels were hexagonal? Could they be arranged on an irregular lattice? What if they overlapped, moved, or had a variety of sizes? What if an image was itself constructed from fragments of other images, or from a database of tiny icons, symbols, flags, or emojis? 
This project will employ an outside data source: images (photographs, drawings, etc.), video, text (qualitative or quantitative data), or sound files and timers to produce transformations in that data. You could consider using an api to grab info from another application or service (e.g. Google, X, etc). With your piece, consider the connection between your data and how you are using and interpreting it. This work should have a critical standpoint â€“ that does not mean it has to offer a judgment or assessment (positive or negative) but rather that it makes visible things that might otherwise be hidden or not considered or taken for granted.
You should be conscious of the tools you are using and aware of how you are using them. Think carefully about your pixel concept and the image(s) you choose to transform. 

Goals:
* To reflect on the constitution and perception of images in art, design, and digital imaging.
* To explore the relationship between an image and its component parts
